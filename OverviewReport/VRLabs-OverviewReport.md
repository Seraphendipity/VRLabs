## Introduction

To my understanding, you can more or less copy and tweak your project proposal to add to this section, depending on how much detail you went into in that report.

Note the major concerns of this section:
* Introducing the problem
  * Background Research
* Discussing briefly alternative solutions [^ExistingSolutions]
* Overview of your potential solution

Depending on your writing, may want to split these into headers, or tie them together in a single section.

[^ExistingSolutions]: Specifically, where they fail to address the problem; essentially your project is justified on the basis of "nothing out there provides this". That said, we were not focused necessarily on proprietary IP's, as such I'm not entirely sure how much detail with which this needs to be addressed.
